The Scoop
=========

*Sapce* is a project born of [UVic GameDev](http://uvicgamedev.com/)'s NoJam 2012 game jam. Inspired by the theme of emergent behaviour, the grandiose vision is best described as a space sim whose procedurally generated ships evolve over generations. In terms of intellecutal theft, it lands somewhere between [Boxcar2d](http://boxcar2d.com/) and [Captain Forever](http://www.captainforever.com/captainforever.php).

Naturally, the game as developed during the jam is a shy whisper of that bold design. Whatevs. The project lives here now. The idea of it is fun enough that the code may see some tinkering, but what's there is yours to check out.
